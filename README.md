# ReadMe: Universal Bibtex File for Atmospheric Composition

A constantly updated universal bibtex file stored on GitHub that I can use with LaTeX to create a .bbl file relevant for each article. My research area is atmospheric science, in particular atmospheric composition and chemistry. The majority of references relate to:
- carbon monoxide
- biomass burning
- climate-chemistry interactions
- global modelling
- remote-sensing (both satellite and ground-based)

However, there may be other relevant articles referenced.
